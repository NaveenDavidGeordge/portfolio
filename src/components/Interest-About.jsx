      <p>
        I’m a person who draws inspiration from many places, and my interests shape the way I think, create, and work.
<br /> <br />
I enjoy exploring superbikes and cars, understanding their design, engineering, and the experience they offer. Music is another space where I find focus and energy, whether it’s for relaxation or deep work.
<br /> <br />
I love creating and editing videos, especially when combining visuals, storytelling, and sound. Coding naturally fits into this creative rhythm — I enjoy the vibe of building things, solving problems, and constantly improving.
<br /> <br />
Cinema inspires me with visuals, emotions, and ideas, while cooking brings balance, creativity, and calm into my routine. I also spend time exploring spiritual topics, which helps me stay grounded and mindful.
<br /> <br />
All these interests shape who I am, both personally and as a developer.
