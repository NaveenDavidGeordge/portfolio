        I’m Naveen Kumar, born and raised in Deveseri, a peaceful village near Alanganallur in Madurai District, Tamil Nadu. Growing up in a calm and close-knit environment shaped my values — simplicity, discipline, and the importance of strong relationships.
<br /><br />
I’ve always been surrounded by supportive siblings and friends, and that has played a big role in who I am today. Whether it’s learning, exploring, or simply enjoying small moments, I value healthy connections and meaningful conversations.
<br /><br />
My journey into technology started with curiosity and a constant drive to build, improve, and understand how things work. That curiosity eventually turned into a career path where I get to combine creativity, logic, and problem-solving every day.
<br /><br />
I see myself as someone who keeps evolving — learning from challenges, staying grounded in my roots, and always aiming to grow personally and professionally. <br />
This portfolio reflects my work, my progress, and the experiences that shaped me.
