    <br />
    <p>
At Stradegi Solutions, I led UI development for nFlows, a powerful no-code automation platform. My responsibilities included revamping UI modules, enhancing performance, implementing clean code practices, and solving production issues.
    </p><br />
    <p>
I customized Telerik UI components to meet complex financial and enterprise requirements. I also mentored frontend team members, improving performance standards and code quality across projects.
    </p><br />
    <p>
Beyond frontend work, I collaborated with backend teams to debug Java-based data logic issues, ensuring stable and accurate data flow between UI and APIs.
    </p><br />
<p>
I developed and maintained an internal web application used by the entire department to track workflow enhancements, defects, check-ins, RD findings, release summaries, and issue logs, improving productivity and transparency.

<p>
I also contributed UI support across multiple Stradegi products, ensuring consistency, accessibility, and responsiveness across the ecosystem.
