Frontend Developer (Jul 2022 – Mar 2024)
    </h3>
<br />
<p>
At Alphabet Techs, I started my career by designing and developing modern, responsive websites for various business domains. I worked extensively with WordPress, Bootstrap, Metronic, and custom CSS to create visually appealing and mobile-friendly interfaces.
</p>
    
<br />
<p>

I built and customized WordPress plugins tailored to client-specific workflows, especially in e-commerce and service-based projects. I also handled client communication, requirement gathering, ticket systems, and ensured timely delivery of features.
</p>
<br />
<p>

My role expanded into building backend-integrated dashboards using PHP CURL and contributing to a core e-commerce platform inspired by Shopify. I developed reusable UI components, managed data flow, and integrated APIs for seamless user experiences.
</p><br />
<p>
I also worked with Angular v14 to build an admin dashboard module that improved usability, scalability, and project maintainability.
