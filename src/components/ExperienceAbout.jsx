    <p> 
        I am a Front-End Developer with strong experience in building responsive, scalable, and performance-optimized web applications. I began my career at <Link className="text-[lightgoldenrodyellow]" to={'alphabet-techs'}><u> Alphabet Techs</u></Link> , designing and developing websites, custom dashboards, and e-commerce solutions using WordPress, Bootstrap, Metronic, and Angular. I later advanced to <Link className="text-[lightgoldenrodyellow]" to={'stradegi-solutions'}><u>Stradegi Solutions</u> </Link> , where I worked as a Technical Analyst and led UI development for nFlows, a no-code platform used across multiple internal products.
    </p>
    <br />
    <p>

My work includes enhancing UI modules, customizing complex components (Telerik, MUI, Metronic), and implementing clean, maintainable code. I also collaborate closely with backend teams, debugging Java and SQL-based logic issues to ensure smooth data integration. I’ve developed internal tools that streamline workflows, track progress, and improve project transparency.
    </p> <br />
    <p>
With proficiency in React, Next.js, JavaScript, Tailwind CSS, Java, and SQL, I bring a balanced understanding of both frontend development and backend fundamentals. I am detail-oriented, team-focused, and passionate about creating polished, user-friendly interfaces that deliver real value.
